## 🎮 What is StatusWindow?

StatusWindow brings the iconic blue status windows from manga and manhwa into real life. Just like protagonists who can see their stats, skills, and progression through mystical interfaces, you can now track your real-world growth with that same aesthetic. Complete activities, gain experience, and watch your abilities improve through a beautifully designed status system inspired by your favorite webtoons.

> **⚠️ Developer Note**: This is a passion project built by a beginner developer with the help of Vercel v0. The entire site is "vibe-coded" - meaning it prioritizes the aesthetic and feel over perfect functionality. Expect some bugs and quirks as this is very much a work in progress!

**🎯 Perfect for**: Manga/manhwa fans, goal-oriented individuals, productivity enthusiasts, anyone who's ever wanted their own status window interface.
